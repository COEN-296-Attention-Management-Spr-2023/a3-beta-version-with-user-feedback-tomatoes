This is a Chrome extension to help users manage their workflow based on the theory of Pomodora Time Management. 
#It divides time into two parts, work and break. For each part, there is a timer. Notification tells when each timer finishes. Users decides what sites are in the blacklist that will be blocked during work interval. Or, users set a whitelist of sites to be only allowed during work. There are two modes of break. Free mode provides a free break with all sites available to visit. Physical mode will block all websites to push users to do some physical exercise. There are two work scenarios.
